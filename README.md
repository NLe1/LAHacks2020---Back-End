# LAHacks2020-Back-End
The backend is deployed on Oracle Cloud Interface at http://150.136.114.158:8080. For OCI deployment, I referenced this Medium article: https://medium.com/oracledevs/getting-started-with-oracle-cloud-infrastructure-6b048dad480c. I installed Node by extracting the tar I downloaded via `curl` on the official Node.JS website. I used the forever npm package to well, run `node server.js` forever.

It's also deployed on Google Cloud Platform App Engine at https://inner-magpie-257319.appspot.com.
